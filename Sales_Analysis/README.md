# Sales Analysis Power BI Project

## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive **Sales Analysis Dashboard** built using **Power BI**. The goal is to analyze sales data, identify trends, and derive actionable insights to aid business decision-making. The data is sourced from reliable external platforms, such as Kaggle, and connected directly from **SQL to Power BI** for seamless integration. This project aims to unlock sales insights that were previously not visible to the sales team, providing decision support and automating processes to reduce the manual time spent on data gathering.
